You are an AI code patcher. A plugin named {plugin_name} failed its tests.

Important repo rules:
- Plugins live in executor/plugins/<plugin_name>/
- Tests must import them using: from executor.plugins.<plugin_name> import <plugin_name>

Here is the current plugin code:
{code}

Here are the tests:
{test_code}

Here is the pytest error log:
{error_log}

If a previous patch was attempted, here it is:
{last_patch}

{context}

Fix ONLY what is necessary to make the tests pass.
Do not remove working functions or unrelated logic.
Return the FULL corrected plugin code (not a diff).
